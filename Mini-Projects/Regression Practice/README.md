## Model Evaluation Metrics
## Practice: Regression Metrics

## Objective
To gain some insight into a number of techniques used to understand how well our model is performing. This notebook is aimed at giving you some practice with the metrics specifically related to regression problems. With that in mind, we will again be looking at the Boston Housing dataset.

### The following algorithms were evaluated using R2 Score, Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- AdaBoost 
- Linear Regression

This was done to see which algorithms performed best in each metric.

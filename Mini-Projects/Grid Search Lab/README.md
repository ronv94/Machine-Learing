## Training and Tuning
## Project: Grid Search Lab

## Introduction
In this mini-lab, we'll fit a decision tree model to some sample data. This initial model will overfit heavily. Then we'll use Grid Search to find better parameters for this model, to reduce the overfitting.

### Important Concepts:
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple
- Good fit: When a model is neither too simple nor complex
- Overfitting: When a model is too complex as it tries goes above and beyond in training, but doesn't learn actually

## Model Evaluation Metrics
## Practice: Classification Metrics

## Objective
To gain some insight into a number of techniques used to understand how well our model is performing. This notebook is aimed at giving you some practice with the metrics specifically related to classification problems. With that in mind, we will again be looking at the spam dataset.

Confusion Matrix and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-beta scores were used to compare performances of different algorithms.

### The following algorithms were compared using the Confusion Matrix and metrics :
- Naive Bayes
- Bagging
- Random Forests
- AdaBoost 
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
